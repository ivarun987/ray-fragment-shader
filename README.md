# Ray fragment shader

Raycasting and raytracing methods implements with GLSL

## How to run these shaders ?

You can use glslViewer if you want to run these shaders immediately. There is a submodule to do that in this project. Also, you can use it in your own GLSL program.

`glslviewer <shader_name>.frag -w 800 -h 600`

## Circle

`circle.frag`

This shader shows you how to switch between screen coordinate and world coordinate in 2D. Then, it just draws a circle.
